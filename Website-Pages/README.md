## ByteAcademy - Personalized Applied learning

### Personalized
We believe every student learns differently and value above all else - ensuring we understand and weaponize these differences. We do this in two ways.
* Daily 1on1s - We ensure every student has 1on1 meetings with teaching staff on a daily basis to communicate concerns early on
* Personal AI Tutor - Aiza is our AI that will closely monitor everything you submit at Byte to provide customized content tailored for you

### Applied
As fun and interesting theory is, our goal at Byte is to get people jobs. Therefore after understanding how you learn, our focus is teaching the knowledge most relevant in the industry today. We do this in two ways.
* Real-World Projects - We ensure every project you are tasked with is an open problem that publically exists and most employers will know about
* Real-World Experience - Spryte is our internship wing where, upon graduation - you will have an opportunity to gain the critical real-world experience you need for your first job 

## Aiza- Personal AI Tutor
Meet Aiza - your personal AI tutor. As you progress through the course, Aiza closely monitors your assessments, exercises alongside asking you what topics you think you're strong and weak at. It uses this information to design a customized learning experienceto help strengthen the exact areas you are weak at!

Alongside helping customize our content for you, Aiza will also make your teaching staff aware of any technical shortcomings that may be present. So if you're ever lost and don't know how to ask for help, don't worry - we'll come to you.

## Spryte - Applied Experience
Spryte is where you actualize your knowledge on real world projects. Upon graduation we provide you with an opportunity to be apart of a development team tasked with building software for external companies. This will allow you to gain hands-on experience with the non-academic side of software including developing with a team and setting projections/deadlines. 

# Data Science Page
## Home Section
Data Science is a discipline concerned with finding meaningful patterns in complex data. Data is everywhere today and most companies are hungry to find patterns in the data. Whether it's determining how a stock price will change or finding the relationship between diapers and crib sales to determine buying patterns in mothers, the applications are endless.

The goal of this program is to teach you the theoretical ideas to exact meaningful patterns, as well as the applied coding skills to turn this theory into practice. The program is intense but produces quality data scientists able to get jobs at most major companies.
